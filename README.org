* Custom =bash= scripts for linux

  This repo contains a bunch of (more or less) useful =bash= scripts. Below you
  will find a list of the scripts, together with a brief decription and their
  requirements.


** =openman= -- enhanced search and visualization for =man=

   This script let you interactively choose the manual to read and opens it as a
   /pdf/ file in you default pdf viewer.

   This is a list of dependencies, which most of them are installed by default
   in many GNU/Linux ditros:

   + =man= as the system's reference manuals interface.
   + =groff= as the pdf formatter.
   + =xdg-open= to open the pdf file with the default viewer.
   + =dmenu= to interactively select the manual to open.
